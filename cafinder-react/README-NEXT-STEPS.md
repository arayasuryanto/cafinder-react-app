# Next Steps for Cafinder React Implementation

## Immediate To-Do

1. **Copy Image Assets**
   - Copy all images from the original project to the React project's public directory
   - Update image paths in components

2. **Fix Component Rendering**
   - Ensure all components render properly without errors
   - Test navigation between pages
   - Check responsive design on different screen sizes

3. **Complete Data Integration**
   - Import the complete cafe data from JSON
   - Ensure context provider properly supplies data to components
   - Implement filtering and search functionality

4. **Implement Map Features**
   - Complete Mapbox integration with proper coordinates
   - Add markers for all cafes
   - Implement filtering on the map

## Future Enhancements

1. **State Management**
   - Consider using Redux or Zustand for more complex state management if needed
   - Implement proper caching for API requests

2. **Authentication**
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement user profiles
   - Allow users to save cafes to their profile

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Add code splitting for different routes
   - Optimize bundle size

4. **Progressive Web App Features**
   - Add service worker for offline capabilities
   - Implement push notifications
   - Add "Add to Home Screen" functionality

5. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests with Jest
   - Add integration tests with React Testing Library
   - Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress

## Code Organization

As the project grows, consider further organization:

- Split large components into smaller ones
- Create more reusable hooks for common functionality
- Organize styles with either CSS modules or a styling library like styled-components
- Implement proper TypeScript types for type safety

## Deployment

When ready to deploy:

1. Build the production version:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy to a hosting service:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
