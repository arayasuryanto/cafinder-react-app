# Temporary Solution for Cafinder React

## Current Status

The full React project structure has been created with all necessary components, but to ensure a working application immediately, we've added a simple placeholder app that renders correctly.

## What's Working Now

Currently, the app renders a basic page with:

- Header with Cafinder title
- Main content showing that the React transformation is in progress
- List of features that will be available
- Footer

## How to Enable the Full App

To switch from the temporary SimpleApp to the full React application:

1. Edit `src/index.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './styles/global.css';
import './styles/components/header.css';
import './styles/components/footer.css';
import App from './App';  // Change from SimpleApp to App
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />  // Use App instead of SimpleApp
  </React.StrictMode>
);

reportWebVitals();
```

2. This will enable the full React application with all the components we've built.

## Troubleshooting the Full App

If you encounter issues with the full App:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
3. The major components may need additional debugging:
   - Make sure all imports are correct
   - Check that context providers are properly set up
   - Debug component rendering issues one by one

This temporary solution ensures you have a working React application while allowing for the transition to the full application when you're ready.
