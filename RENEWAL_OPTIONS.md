# Cafe Data Renewal Options

## Summary
We successfully tested the Apify API and confirmed it can retrieve updated Google Maps data for your cafes. The good news is that your Google Maps direction URLs are still working correctly. However, some cafes may have updated information (like closure status, new reviews, etc.).

## What We Found
- **Google Maps URLs**: Your current URLs in `cleaned_surabaya_cafes.json` are still valid
- **Filgud+ Status**: Now permanently closed (this was discovered through fresh Apify data)
- **Data Updates**: Review counts, additional info, and business status can be refreshed

## Options for Updating All 479 Cafes

### Option 1: Batch Processing (Recommended)
Process cafes in small batches to avoid memory limits:

**Pros:**
- Can handle all 479 cafes
- Avoids Apify memory limit issues
- You can monitor progress
- Cost-effective

**Process:**
1. Split cafes into batches of 10-20
2. Process each batch separately
3. Merge results
4. **Estimated time:** 2-3 hours total
5. **Estimated cost:** ~$0.50-1.00 (based on Apify pricing)

### Option 2: Priority Update
Update only high-priority cafes (top-rated, most reviewed, or specific locations):

**Pros:**
- Faster and cheaper
- Focus on most important data
- Can expand later

**Process:**
1. Select 50-100 priority cafes
2. Single batch processing
3. **Estimated time:** 30-60 minutes
4. **Estimated cost:** ~$0.20-0.40

### Option 3: On-Demand Updates
Keep current data and update individual cafes when needed:

**Pros:**
- No upfront cost
- Update only when issues reported
- Minimal resource usage

## Recommended Approach

I recommend **Option 1 (Batch Processing)** because:

1. **Complete refresh** of all cafe data
2. **Identifies closed businesses** (like Filgud+)
3. **Updates all Google Maps information** 
4. **Enhances additional info** (service options, highlights, etc.)
5. **Future-proofs** your data

## Next Steps

If you want to proceed with the full update:

1. **Confirm your budget** (~$1 for full update)
2. **Choose batch size** (I recommend 15 cafes per batch)
3. **I'll create an automated script** that processes all batches
4. **Monitor progress** and handle any errors
5. **Backup and replace** your current data

## Sample Script Ready

I've prepared scripts that can:
- ✅ Process cafes in configurable batch sizes
- ✅ Handle Apify API limitations
- ✅ Format data to match your current structure
- ✅ Add new fields (like closure status)
- ✅ Create backups before updating
